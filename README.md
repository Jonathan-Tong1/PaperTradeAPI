# Spring Boot API with JWT Authentication, OAuth2 Login, Two-Factor Authentication, and External API Integration

## Overview

This project demonstrates a secure Spring Boot API with advanced authentication mechanisms and integration of external APIs for cryptocurrency and stock trading. The API supports authentication via JWT tokens, OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub, and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using TOTP. Additionally, the application integrates with external APIs, such as the **CoinGecko API** for cryptocurrency data and the **Finnhub API** for stock trading functionalities.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication for secure API access.
- **OAuth2 Login**: Social login integration with Google and GitHub.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhanced security using TOTP-based authentication.
- **External API Integration**:
    - **CoinGecko API**: Fetches real-time cryptocurrency data such as prices, market trends, and more.
    - **Finnhub API**: Enables stock trading operations and provides financial market insights.
- **Stock Trading**: Supports placing and managing trades for stocks through the Finnhub API.
- **MySQL Database**: Stores user credentials, OAuth2 details, and 2FA settings.
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for user authentication, cryptocurrency data retrieval, and stock trading operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for developing the backend API.
- **Spring Security**: Manages authentication and authorization logic.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Enables stateless authentication for API access.
- **OAuth2**: Allows secure social logins with Google and GitHub.
- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: Adds an extra layer of security through Two-Factor Authentication.
- **MySQL**: Database for persisting user information and 2FA settings.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies interaction with the MySQL database.
- **CoinGecko API**: Fetches cryptocurrency data for use within the application.
- **Finnhub API**: Provides real-time stock data and trading functionalities.

## Key Functionalities

1. **User Authentication**:
    - Register and log in using username and password.
    - OAuth2 login via Google and GitHub.

2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
    - Enhances security by requiring a TOTP generated by an external authenticator app.

3. **Cryptocurrency Data**:
    - Retrieves cryptocurrency market data from the CoinGecko API.
    - Provides information on pricing, trends, and trading volumes.

4. **Stock Trading**:
    - Enables users to view stock data, place trades, and manage portfolios via the Finnhub API.
    - Offers market insights and real-time updates.

5. **Database Management**:
    - Stores user credentials, OAuth2 login details, 2FA settings, and trade history in a MySQL database.

## Benefits of External API Integration

- **CoinGecko API**: Offers up-to-date cryptocurrency information for informed decision-making.
- **Finnhub API**: Simplifies stock trading operations and market analysis, making it accessible for users.

This project combines robust security with real-world trading functionalities, demonstrating the power of integrating external APIs into a Spring Boot application.
